# Data_Visualization_with_Python_Coursera_Project
Coursera-Project These course materials belong entirely to Coursera. The answers are the only things that show my trials.  Key Concepts: Use Pandas to produce a table to visualize the data. Produce a data plot using MatPlotLib Pyplot. Use Seaborn to create a scatterplot graph. Create a Jointplot to show distribution. Create a heatmap to show correlations and distributions. Great thanks to the course instructor:.
